First, I would like to express my deepest thanks to my supervisor, Gabriele Keller for her gentle encouragements, patience and guidance. I would like to thank Trevor McDonnell and Liam O'Connor for their encyclopedic knowledge and superbness. 

Also much love and thanks to my parents and sister for their long-suffering patience and support.
