\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}

An implementation of a neural network in Accelerate may offer a convenient alternative to current CUDA or Python implementations in testing for the validity of hypotheses. 

The aim of the project is to implement a ConvNet in Accelerate. ConvNet is similar to FFBP neural networks, and thus should be possible to build upon the implementation in~\cite{Eve16}. 

However, further research and knowledge is necessary in order to achieve this goal.
