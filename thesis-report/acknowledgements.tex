\chapter*{Acknowledgements}\label{ack}

First, I would like to express my deepest thanks to my supervisor, Gabriele Keller for her gentle encouragements, patience and guidance. I would also like to thank all the members of UNSW Programming Languages and Systems (PLS) group for additional support and assistance, and for being an invaluable wealth of knowledge. In particular, I would like to thank Liam O'Connor for his generous aid. 

I am very grateful to have learned so much during Thesis A, and look forward increasing my knowledge further in Thesis B!
