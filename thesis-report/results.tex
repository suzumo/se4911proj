\chapter{Results}\label{ch:results}

I have used Le Cunn's handwritten digit data set to test the relative performance of MATLAB and Accelerate conversion of the code. The backend of Accelerate is \texttt{llvm} as this handset is too small to test on the GPU for now. 

\section{Performance results}

The result of this work is the present document, being both a \LaTeX\
template and a thesis requirement specification.

\section{Others etc}

The Dual function of this document somewhat de-emphasises the primary
purpose of the document, namely the thesis requirements.  It would be
better, if these could be stated on a few concise pages (cf Appendix
1, p\pageref{app1}).
