\chapter{Evaluation}\label{ch:eval}

This section contains the evaluation of the result and the overall significance of my thesis result in the light of project's objective.

\section{Discussion} \label{se:eval.discuss}

The result of this work is the present document, being both a \LaTeX\
template and a thesis requirement specification.

\section{Benefits of Accelerate implementation} \label{se:impl.benefits}

Acclerate has inherent benefits.

For instance, even if the code is 'inefficient' in the sense that it has repeating parameters, by having 'sharing recovery', Accelerate will reduce the number of parameters to the bare minimum during the production of the ASTs.

\section{Incomplete works} \label{se:eval.incomplete}

The Dual function of this document somewhat de-emphasises the primary
purpose of the document, namely the thesis requirements.  It would be
better, if these could be stated on a few concise pages (cf Appendix
1, p\pageref{app1}).

\section{Future works} \label{se:eval.future}
