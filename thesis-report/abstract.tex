\chapter*{Abstract}\label{abstract}

GPU-accelerated programming is used to speed up neural network computations. However, the main languages for GPU programming are CUDA and OpenCL, which are very low-level languages. This thesis proposes implementing a simple feed-forward back-propagation neural network, namely a convolutional neural network using Accelerate. Accelerate is an Embedded Domain-Specific Language in Haskell for GPU programming and has several accessibility advantages over CUDA, while still offering competitive performance. Once the implementation is successful, I plan to assess its performance, benefits and disadvantages against the traditional approaches with CUDA.
